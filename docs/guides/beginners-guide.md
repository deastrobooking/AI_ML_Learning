## What is AI/ML?

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It includes:
- **Learning**: Acquiring information and rules
- **Reasoning**: Using rules to reach conclusions
- **Self-correction**: Improving through experience

### Machine Learning (ML)
ML is a subset of AI that focuses on creating systems that learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

### Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Data
The foundation of ML. Your model is only as good as your data!

**Types of Data:**
- **Structured**: Tables, databases (e.g., CSV files)
- **Unstructured**: Images, text, audio, video
- **Semi-structured**: JSON, XML

**Data Quality Matters:**
- Clean data (no errors or missing values)
- Relevant data (related to your problem)
- Sufficient data (enough examples to learn from)

### 2. Features
Features are individual measurable properties of the data.

**Example**: Predicting house prices
```python
Features:
- Square footage (number)
- Number of bedrooms (number)
- Location (category)
- Year built (number)

Target: Price (number)
```

### 3. Labels/Targets
The output you want to predict.

### 4. Model
A mathematical representation that learns patterns from data.

**Think of it like this:**
```
Model = Function that maps inputs → outputs
```

### 5. Training
The process of teaching a model to make predictions.

```python
# Simple concept
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    prediction = model(input_data)
    error = calculate_error(prediction, actual_value)
    adjust_model_based_on_error(error)
```

### 6. Evaluation
Testing how well your model performs on new, unseen data.

**Common Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **Precision**: Of predicted positives, how many are correct?
- **Recall**: Of actual positives, how many did we catch?
- **F1-Score**: Balance between precision and recall

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
**You have labeled data** (inputs with corresponding outputs)

**Examples:**
- **Classification**: Categorizing data (spam vs not spam)
- **Regression**: Predicting continuous values (house prices)

```python
# Classification example
Training Data:
Email: "Buy now!" → Label: Spam
Email: "Meeting at 3pm" → Label: Not Spam

Model learns the pattern and can classify new emails
```

**Common Algorithms:**
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
**You have unlabeled data** (only inputs, no outputs)

**Examples:**
- **Clustering**: Grouping similar items
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing number of features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Finding unusual patterns

```python
# Clustering example
Customer Data: [age, income, spending]
↓
Algorithm groups customers into segments:
- Young high spenders
- Budget conscious families
- Luxury seekers
```

**Common Algorithms:**
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- Autoencoders

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
**Learning through trial and error with rewards**

**Examples:**
- Game playing (Chess, Go, video games)
- Robotics
- Autonomous vehicles
- Recommendation systems

```python
# Concept
Agent takes action → Environment gives reward
↓
Agent learns which actions lead to higher rewards
```

## Your First Project

### Project: Iris Flower Classification

Let's build a complete ML pipeline!

```python
# Step 1: Import libraries
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Step 2: Load data
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data  # Features: sepal length, width, petal length, width
y = iris.target  # Labels: 0=setosa, 1=versicolor, 2=virginica

print(f"Dataset shape: {X.shape}")
print(f"Number of classes: {len(set(y))}")

# Step 3: Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)

print(f"Training samples: {len(X_train)}")
print(f"Testing samples: {len(X_test)}")

# Step 4: Create and train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model trained!")

# Step 5: Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Step 6: Evaluate
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"\nAccuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
print("\nDetailed Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, predictions, 
                          target_names=iris.target_names))

# Step 7: Make a prediction on new data
new_flower = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]]  # New flower measurements
prediction = model.predict(new_flower)
print(f"\nPredicted species: {iris.target_names[prediction[0]]}")
```

**Output:**
```
Dataset shape: (150, 4)
Number of classes: 3
Training samples: 120
Testing samples: 30
Model trained!

Accuracy: 100.00%

Detailed Report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
      setosa       1.00      1.00      1.00        10
  versicolor       1.00      1.00      1.00         9
   virginica       1.00      1.00      1.00        11

Predicted species: setosa
```

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Overfitting
**Problem**: Model performs great on training data but poorly on new data

**Solution:**
```python
# Use more data
# Regularization
# Simpler models
# Cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
```

### 2. Underfitting
**Problem**: Model performs poorly on both training and test data

**Solution:**
```python
# More complex model
# Better features
# Train longer
```

### 3. Data Leakage
**Problem**: Test data information leaks into training

**Solution:**
```python
# Always split data BEFORE preprocessing
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X, y)

# Fit scaler only on training data
scaler.fit(X_train)
X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)  # Don't fit again!
```

### 4. Ignoring Data Quality
**Problem**: Garbage in, garbage out

**Solution:**
```python
# Check for missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())

# Check for duplicates
print(df.duplicated().sum())

# Check data types
print(df.dtypes)

# Visualize distributions
df.hist(figsize=(10, 8))
```

### 5. Not Understanding the Problem
**Solution:**
- Clearly define what you're trying to predict
- Understand the business context
- Talk to domain experts
- Start simple, then iterate
